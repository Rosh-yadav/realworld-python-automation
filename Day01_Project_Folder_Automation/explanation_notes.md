# Python Project Folder Script - Explanation Notes

## 1. Functions (`def`)
In Python, `def` is used to define a function. A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. Functions make code reusable and organized.

**Syntax:**
```python
def function_name(parameters):
    # code block
````

**Example:**

```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}")
```

Here, `greet` is a function that prints a greeting for the provided name.

## 2. try-except

The `try-except` block is used for error handling. Code inside `try` is executed normally. If an error occurs, the code inside the `except` block runs instead of crashing.

**Example:**

```python
try:
    number = int("abc")
except ValueError:
    print("That was not a number")
```

---

## 3. f-strings

An f-string is a way to format strings in Python. It starts with the letter `f` before the quotes. Inside the string, variables can be placed in curly braces `{}`.

**Example:**

```python
name = "Rishikes"
print(f"Hello, {name}")
```

**Output:**

```
Hello, Rishikes
```

## 4. parser and argparse

`argparse` is a Python library that helps handle command-line arguments.
`ArgumentParser` creates a parser object, which collects and understands the inputs you type when running the script.

**Example:**

```python
import argparse

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Automate Project Folder Creation')
parser.add_argument('project_name', type=str, help='Name of the project')
args = parser.parse_args()
print(args.project_name)
```

If you run the script as:

```bash
python script.py MyApp
```

Then it will print:

```
MyApp
```

## 5. The main() function and `if __name__ == '__main__'`

The `main()` function is where the program starts. It ties together all the parts of the program.

`if __name__ == '__main__':` is a special Python check. It ensures that the code runs only if the file is executed directly, not if itâ€™s imported in another file.

**Example:**

```python
def main():
    print("This is the main function")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

---

## 6. Creating README.md file

The script creates a `README.md` file in the project folder. It uses Python's `open()` function in write mode (`'w'`).

**Example:**

```python
with open('README.md', 'w') as file:
    file.write("# Project Name\nProject created successfully.")
```
